============

The git project for the True North PHP Conference.  The website is at http://www.truenorthphp.ca

Installation:

  1. `git clone git://github.com/pmeth/truenorthphp.git`
  2. Setup your web server's DocumentRoot to point to the `./public` folder.

If sending pull requests, please use the following conventions:
  1. Use 3 spaces instead of tabs
  2. For php files, put the opening curly brace { on the same line as the control (if, while, foreach, etc.) statement

For speakers looking to update their profile, please do the following:
  1. Open the file with your name in the `./speaker_data/` directory
  2. Update your image, bio and twitter if applicable (also feel free to update any other data there)
  3. Send me a pull request so I can update the live website

Note: You do not have to use gravatar for your image.  Any 200x200 image will do.
Feel free to include an image in the `./public/img/` directory if you do not have an 
appropriate image elsewhere on the web.
